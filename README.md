Playing around with [`camera`](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) and [`file_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker) plugins. This thing is just a very rough proof-of-concept, and it honestly doesn't do anything aside from displaying a camera preview, opens a file picker dialog, and then displays a file name of a picked/taken file. Seriously, only use this project to get started faster.

Only available for Android, because that's the platform I'm focusing on at the moment. For iOS, check documentation of both packages and make necessary changes, and good luck.

## Usage

Make sure you have the latest stable version of Flutter installed. Then,

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run it
flutter run
```
